# Axiomatic Teleportation

This mod adds the Modified Labcoat from Axiom Verge into Minecraft.

To use it, wear it on your chest slot, face a wall, and sprint into it.
After a second you should warp through the wall.

This mod was inspired by Direwolf20's request for an item that lets him walk through walls.
